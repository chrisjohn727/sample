# Getting Started
>This is a developer preview and beta version of Poseidon Next.


## Prerequisites

NodeJs 8 or greater
To check installed node.js version:
node --version
Poseidon Dev Host
Installation
In order to start developing Poseidon Applications, you should get @kognifai/poseidon-dev-host. You can install from NPM globally:
npm install -g @kognifai/poseidon-dev-host
Hosting
After you've globally installed @kognifai/poseidon-dev-host you can start it with the following command:
poseidon-dev-host --next
The console shows a message that it is now listening on http://localhost:8080. Opening the browser on this URL loads up the Poseidon Core. The host comes with a developer friendly security solution. Type in any username and password to enter the application. A full security service will be provided in a future release.
Installing test modules
There are several test modules that can be used as examples for the services provided by the framework. Start by creating an empty directory in your local work directory:
mkdir c:\poseidon-apps\test-modules
cd c:\poseidon-apps\test-modules
You can use NPM to install the test modules:
npm install @kognifai/poseidon-authenticationservicetestpage
npm install @kognifai/poseidon-authorizationservicetestpage
npm install @kognifai/poseidon-configurationservicetestpage
npm install @kognifai/poseidon-datetimeformattingservicetestpage
npm install @kognifai/poseidon-loggingservicetestpage
npm install @kognifai/poseidon-messageservicetestpage
npm install @kognifai/poseidon-settingsservicetestpage
npm install @kognifai/poseidon-statisticsservicetestpage
npm install @kognifai/poseidon-timeseriestestpage
npm install @kognifai/poseidon-toolsmenutestpage
npm install @kognifai/poseidon-uomservicetestpage
You can now tell poseidon-dev-host to load these modules: (Remember stop the poseidon-dev-host if it is currently running. You can do that by pressing Ctrl+C in the console)
poseidon-dev-host --next C:\poseidon-apps\test-modules\node_modules\@kognifai
The last parameter specifies the directory in which poseidon-dev-host will look for modules. A module is considered a directory which contains a module manifest, so the rest of the subdirectories under node_modules (if any) will be ignored. When the command is executed, the host should output a message listing all the modules' manifests it found, similar to:
Scanning modules in C:\poseidon-apps\test-modules\node_modules
                kognifai-poseidon-authenticationservicetestpage.manifest.json
                kognifai-poseidon-authorizationservicetestpage.manifest.json
                ... 
Open a browser at http://localhost:8080 in order to see the modules:

Looking at the module sources
You can open the source code for each of the test modules in VS Code:
code C:\poseidon-apps\test-modules\node_modules\@kognifai/poseidon-authenticationservicetestpage
The test modules provide examples on how to use the services provided by the framework.
Creating a new Poseidon Application
Installing Yeoman
If you have not yet installed Yeoman, you can do so by executing this command:
npm install -g yo
Installing the Yeoman generator
You can install the kognifai-poseidon Yeoman generator from NPM:
npm install -g @kognifai/generator-poseidon
Using the generator
You should use the generator in an empty directory:
mkdir c:\poseidon-apps\modules\my-first-app
cd c:\poseidon-apps\modules\my-first-app
yo @kognifai/poseidon:module
NOTE: It is recommended that the application name specified when using the Yeoman generator is the same as the root folder name on disk. If not, open your [my-app-name].manifest.json file after the application Yeoman generator has run and update the path variable to match your application root folder on disk:
"path": "/Server/Modules/[root_folder_on_disk]/dist/bundles/testapp.umd#AppModule"
This is a temporary workaround.
Follow the instructions of the generator to fill in the required information. After the generator completes, you will have a working simple application.
You can use VS Code to edit the source code
code .
You can use NPM scripts to build, lint, test:
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run test
Starting your application
You can start your application in the same way as the test modules. Point the poseidon-dev-host to the directory of your applications:
poseidon-dev-host --next C:\poseidon-apps\modules
Open a browser at http://localhost:8080 in order to see your application:

Running side-by-side with test modules
As NPM was used to install the test modules, they're located under the c:\poseidon-apps\test-modules\node_modules directory. You can simply copy them to your new C:\poseidon-apps\modules directory, and you can have them loaded side-by-side with your newly created applications.

Using the Kognifai Design System
Kognifai Design System is a collection of design patterns, components and guidelines for creating unified and coherent UI in the Kognifai ecosystem.
It contains a set of easy-to-use HTML/CSS components. It does not include JavaScript since we aim to be versatile and technology agnostic. Use it together with any JS framework.
